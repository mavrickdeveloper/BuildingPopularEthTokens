    ///////////
    
    // Events in Solidity are the same as in any other programming language. 
    // An event is an inheritable member of the contract, which stores the arguments passed in the transaction logs when emitted. 
    // Generally, events are used to inform the calling application about the current state of the contract, with the help of the logging facility of EVM. 
    // Events notify the applications about the change made to the contracts and applications which can be used to execute the dependent logic.

    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint value);

    // Transfer event is emitted when a transfer is made.
    // The event parameters are the sender, the recipient and the amount of tokens transferred.
    // This event is emitted when the amount of tokens (value) is sent from the from address to the to address.
    // In the case of minting new tokens, the transfer is usually from the 0x00..0000 address while in the case of burning tokens the transfer is to 0x00..0000.


    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint value);

    // This event is emitted when the amount of tokens (value) is approved by the owner to be used by the spender.
